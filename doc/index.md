**Vezel** ("fezel") is a non-profit software organization founded in March of
2022 with a focus on creating and maintaining delightful developer-oriented
software such as libraries, build tooling, and compilers. All of our software is
open source and made available under the terms of the exceptionally liberal
[Zero-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/license/0bsd) to ensure that
everyone can benefit from our work. Our finances are completely transparent on
[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/vezel/transactions).

This is the home of our documentation, both for the organization itself and its
various open source projects.
