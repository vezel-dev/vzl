# Finances

Vezel's finances are completely transparent and can be found on
[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/vezel).

Vezel does not seek to advance the financial interests of its members, nor to
maximize profit. Revenue is spent strictly on the following:

1. Funding maintainers of Vezel's open source projects.
2. Sponsoring developers of third-party open source projects that Vezel's
   projects depend on.
3. Operational costs for the organization (domain name, email hosting, software
   licenses, etc).

## Donations

Vezel's only source of revenue is donations from its community. Donations are
possible through the following channels:

* [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/vezel)
* [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/vezel-dev)

Please note that donations are currently *not* tax-deductible.
