# Incorporation

Vezel is currently incorporated in Denmark as a [minor sole proprietorship][0]
and as such is limited to a revenue of 50,000 DKK per year. Should revenue
exceed this amount, the corporation can be turned into a full, unrestricted
[sole proprietorship][1]. [@alexrp](https://github.com/alexrp) is the sole
proprietor.

Vezel is technically regarded as a business and is taxed as such. In actual
practice, however, it is run *similarly to* (but not exactly like) a
[United States 501(c) corporation][2]: Profit is not a goal and the corporation
does not seek to advance the financial interests of any members. The
corporation's finances are completely transparent in order to ensure honesty
and accountability.

In the long term, given sufficient community growth, Vezel could potentially be
transformed into a tax-exempt non-profit [association][3] with bylaws and a
board of directors.
